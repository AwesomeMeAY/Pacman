.SH NAME
pacsync \- package update frontend for pacman
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpacsync  [--root <root>] <operation> [package] [package] ...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpacsync\fP is a \fIpackage update\fP frontend for the
\fIpacman\fP package manager.  It keeps track of the versions
of packages installed on the local system and the versions of
packages on a remote server.  This allows you to issue a single
command and have you system's packages brought into sync.
.SH OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "sync"
Download a new copy of the package list from the server.  This
should be done regularly, usually before an "install", "upgrade"
or "sysupgrade" command.
.TP
.B "install <package>"
Install a new package. \fBpacsync\fP will first look for the package
in the cache directory.  If it is not there, it will attempt to
download the file from the server.  On success, the package will
be installed.  (Note that the downloaded file is also copied to
a cache directory on your filesystem.  You can delete it with
"clean").
.TP
.B "upgrade <package>"
Upgrade a package.  This is the same as \fIinstall\fP, except a package
is upgraded (ie, it is already installed in the system).
.TP
.B "report"
Generate an upgrade report.  This operation will compare all local
package versions to remote versions, and then show you a report of
the differences.
.TP
.B "sysupgrade"
Full system upgrade.  This is the same as report except after confirmation,
\fBpacsync\fP will upgrade all packages that are not up to date.
.TP
.B "clean"
This will remove all downloaded packages from the cache directory.  This
can/should be used regularly to free up diskspace.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration options are stored in /etc/pacsync.conf.  Currently there is only
one directive.
.TP
.B "SYNC_SERVER"
This should be set to the full URL of the download server closest to you.
FTP is preferred, but HTTP is supported also, provided you have wget.
