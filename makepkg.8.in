.SH NAME
makepkg \- package build utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmakepkg\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmakepkg\fP will build packages for you.  All it needs is
a build-capable linux platform, wget, and some build scripts.  The advantage
to a script-based build is that you only really do the work once.  Once you
have the build script for a package, you just need to run makepkg and it
will do the rest: download source files, configure the buildtime settings,
build the package, install the package into a temporary root, make
customizations, and package the whole thing up for pacman to use.

\fBmakeworld\fP can be used to rebuild an entire package group, or the
entire build tree.
.SH BUILD PROCESS (or How To Build Your Own Packages)
Start in an isolated directory (ie, it's not used for anything other
than building this package).  The build script should be called PKGBUILD
and it should bear resemblance to the example below.

.TP
.TP
.SH PKGBUILD Example:
.RS
.nf
pkgname=modutils
pkgver=2.4.13
pkgrel=1
backup=(etc/modules.conf)
source=(ftp://ftp.server.com/$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz modules.conf)

build() {
  cd $startdir/src/$pkgname-$pkgver
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make || return 1
  make prefix=$startdir/pkg/usr install
  # copy our custom modules.conf into the package root
  mkdir -p $startdir/pkg/etc
  cp ../modules.conf $startdir/pkg/etc
}
.fi
.RE

As you can see, the setup is fairly simple.  The first three lines define
the package name and version info.  They also define the final package name,
which will be of the form $pkgname-$pkgver-$pkgrel.pkg.tar.gz

The sources are then decompressed (if necessary) into a directory called ./src.
Then the \fIbuild\fP function is called.  This is where all package configuration,
building, and installing should be done.  Any customization will likely take
place here.

After a package is built, the \fIbuild\fP function must install the package
files into a special package root, which can be referenced by \fB$startdir/pkg\fP
in the \fIbuild\fP function.  The typical way to do this is one of the following:
.RS
.nf

make DESTDIR=$startdir/pkg install

or

make prefix=$startdir/pkg/usr install

.fi
.RE
Notice that the "/usr" portion should be present with "prefix", but not "DESTDIR."

Once the package is successfully installed into the package root, \fImakepkg\fP
will remove some directories (as per Arch Linux package guidelines; if you use
this elsewhere, feel free to change it) like /usr/doc and /usr/info.  It will
then strip debugging info from libraries and binaries and compress everything
into a .pkg.tar.gz file in the directory you ran \fBmakepkg\fP from.

At this point you should have a package file in the current directory, named
something like name-version-release.pkg.tar.gz.  Done!

.SH Install/Upgrade/Remove Scripting
Pacman has the ability to store and execute a package-specific script when it
installs, removes, or upgrades a package.  This allows a package to "configure
itself" after installation and do the opposite right before it is removed.

The exact time the script is run varies with each operation:
.TP
.B post_install
script is run right after files are installed.

.TP
.B post_upgrade
script is run after all files have been upgraded.

.TP
.B pre_remove
script is run right before files are removed.

.RE
In order to use this feature, your build function should put the script in
$startdir/pkg/var/lib/pacman/scripts and it must be named exactly the same
as the \fI$pkgname\fP variable in the PKGBUILD script.  For example, an
install script for grep will be $startdir/pkg/var/lib/pacman/scripts/grep.
Note that the scripts should be 644, not 755 (we don't need execute permission).

.TP
.TP
.SH Install scripts must follow this format:
.RS
.nf
# arg 1:  the new package version
post_install() {
  #
  #  do post-install stuff here
  #
}

# arg 1:  the new package version
# arg 2:  the old package version
post_upgrade() {
  #
  #  do post-upgrade stuff here
  #
}

# arg 1:  the old package version
pre_remove() {
  #
  #  do pre-remove stuff here
  #
}

op=$1
shift

$op $*
.fi
.RE

This template is also available in your ABS tree (/usr/abs/install.proto).

.SH PKGBUILD Directives
.TP
.B pkgname
The name of the package.  This has be a unix-friendly name as it will be
used in the package filename.

.TP
.B pkgver
This is the version of the software as released from the author (eg, 2.7.1).

.TP
.B pkgrel
This is the release number specific to Arch Linux packages.

.TP
.B backup
A space-delimited array of filenames (without a preceding slash). The
\fIbackup\fP line will be propagated to the package meta-info file for
pacman.  This will designate all files listed there to be backed up if this
package is ever removed from a system.

.TP
.B source
The \fIsource\fP line is an array of source files required to build the
package.  Source files must reside in the same directory as the PKGBUILD
file, unless they have a fully-qualified URL.  Then if the source file
does not already exist in /var/cache/pacman/src, the file is downloaded
by wget.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration options are stored in /etc/makepkg.conf.  This file is parsed
as a bash script, so you can export any special compiler flags you wish
to use.  This is helpful for building for different architectures, or with
different optimizations.

\fBNOTE:\fP This does not guarantee that all package Makefiles will use
your exported variables.  Some of them are flaky...
