- check $PACCONF env var
- ftp transfer progress bar breaks after ~42000 K
- use a 'trust pacman' config option for downgrading?
- use a provides tag (instead of an OR operator in depends)
- instead of 'conflicts' use a ! operator in depends
- add a --pretend option
- add a consistency/sanity check operation
- add a --dbpath option
- build-time (source) dependencies in makepkg
- auto-resolve dependencies in makepkg
- use package caches more for performance
+ add an "ignore package" option in either pacman.conf or in each package
  record. this will prevent it from being upgraded from the sync set
- duplicate dep checks occur with sync (one in sync, one in add)
- clean up output a bit (message queue?)
- add an OR operator to dependencies or allow a sibling tag (ie, mawk, gawk)
- run ldd on every executable in a newly built package to find required so's
- add a freshen operation
- allow multiple ftp servers to be defined and fallback to backups on failure
- use a files.cache gdbm (or whatever) for --owns and db_find_conflicts
- things like 'groupadd' and 'useradd' in the install scriptlets will affect
  the real root, not the one specified with -r
