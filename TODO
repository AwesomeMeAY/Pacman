- think about consolidating the -A/-U/-S options into one smart
  install operation
- replaces code doesn't run with -U or -A
- when performing replaces, pacman should not remove old packages until
  the conflict checks are passed
- --info should work with --sync to display dependencies
- add an ETA to the download progress bar
- add HTTP/1.1 support
- fix the broken pipe bug
- handle version comparators in makepkg dep resolution (eg, glibc>=2.2.5)
- add post_remove, pre_install, pre_upgrade functions to scriptlets
? record md5sums of all files in a package
? use 'set -e' in makepkg?
- check $PACCONF env var
- add a --pretend option
