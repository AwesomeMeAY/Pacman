These are things that should get done at some point.  Some are simple,
others are more complex and could be a while in development.

- add a [sibling] option to .PKGINFO -- used when only one of
  the siblings can be installed at a time (eg, bsdinit,sysvinit)
- handle wildcards on the command line
- sort packages by package name in pacman.db
- manage conditional file installs (ie, 'info' pages)
- make sure program consistently returns a non-zero return code on
  error, so scripts can rely on it
- maybe add a 'confirm every action' option for doing paranoid installs
- add better directory tracking
  - use crux's pkgmk technique. $(make prefix=$PKG/usr install) then just
    $(cd $PKG; tar czf $pkg.tar.gz *)
- add a consistency check operation
- change char[xxx] to char[PATH_MAX]
- add file locking to db
- add a --dbpath option
- dependency checking
- fetch files via ftp
  - need to manage foreign package lists like apt
- handle .save files better (for more than just .conf files)
- upgrade currently does a double db backup; not really desirable
