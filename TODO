- add a way to clean /var/cache/pacman/src
- add other options to config file: db location, overwrite behaviour, etc.
- don't skip the db update when a package fails to upgrade - we lose the entry
- have "group" designations
? use 'set -e' in makepkg?
x if a package fails, ask before aborting the full operation
  - can't -- further dependent packages may fail b/c of the first failure
? ask, then remove conflicting packages with --sync
? use a provides tag (instead of an OR operator in depends)
- add a freshen operation
- add a 'cascade' option to --remove that will remove a package and
  all requiredby packages under it
- check $PACCONF env var
- ftp transfer progress bar breaks after ~42000 K
? use a 'trust pacman' config option for downgrading?
- instead of 'conflicts' use a ! operator in depends
- add a --pretend option
- add a consistency/sanity check operation
- add a --dbpath option
? build-time (source) dependencies in makepkg
- auto-resolve dependencies in makepkg
- use package caches more for performance
- IgnorePkg option in pacman.conf to ignore updates from the sync repo
- if a package is removed with --nodeps and re-installed, the requiredby
  fields of it's required packages are not updated
- duplicate dep checks occur with sync (one in sync, one in add)
- clean up output a bit (message queue?)
? run ldd on every executable in a newly built package to find required so's
- use a files.cache gdbm (or whatever) for --owns and db_find_conflicts
