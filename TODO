- fix the broken pipe bug
- handle version comparators in makepkg dep resolution (eg, glibc>=2.2.5)
- add post_remove, pre_install, pre_upgrade functions to scriptlets
- record md5sums of all files in a package
? use 'set -e' in makepkg?
x if a package fails, ask before aborting the full operation
  - can't -- further dependent packages may fail b/c of the first failure
- check $PACCONF env var
? use a 'trust pacman' config option for downgrading?
? build-time (source) dependencies in makepkg
? run ldd on every executable in a newly built package to find required so's
- add a --pretend option
- add a consistency/sanity check operation (md5 tracking for all files)
- use package caches more for performance
- clean up output a bit (message queue?)
- use a files.cache db for --owns and db_find_conflicts
