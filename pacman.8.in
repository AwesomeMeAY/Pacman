.SH NAME
pacman \- package manager utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpacman  <operation> [options] <package>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpacman\fP is a \fIpackage management\fP utility.  Package
information is maintained in a basic text format for easy
tweaking, if necessary, and packages are in a standard
\fIgzipped tar\fP format.
.SH OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "\-A, \-\-add"
Add a package to the system.  Package will be uncompressed
into the installation root and the database will be updated.
.TP
.B "\-R, \-\-remove"
Remove a package from the system.  Files belonging to the
specified package will be deleted, and the database will
be updated.  Note that files with \fI.conf\fP extensions will
be renamed with \fI.conf.save\fP extensions.
.TP
.B "\-U, \-\-upgrade"
Upgrade a package.  This is essentially a "remove-then-install"
process.  Files with \fI.conf\fP extensions will be saved.
.TP
.B "\-Q, \-\-query"
Query the package database.  This operation allows you to
view installed packages and their files.  See \fBQUERY OPTIONS\fP
below.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Display version and exit.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Display syntax for the given operation.  If no operation was
supplied, then the general syntax is shown.
.SH QUERY OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-o, \-\-owns <file>"
Output the name of the package that owns <file>.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-list"
Instead of outputting the package name, output the list of
files owned by the package.
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-info"
Output the .PKGINFO file contained in <package>.  This option
can only be used with the \fB-p\fP option.
.TP
.B "\-p, \-\-file"
Tells pacman that the package supplied on the command line is a
file, not an entry in the database.  Pacman will decompress the
file and query it.  This is useful with \fB--info\fP and \fB--list\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Output more status and error messages.
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-force"
Force installation, overwriting conflicting files.  If the package
that is about to be installed contains files that are already
installed this option will cause all those files to be overwritten.
This option should be used with care, preferably not at all.
.TP
.B "\-n, \-\-nosave"
Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations.  Normally, when
a file is about to be removed from the system, the database is first
checked to see if the file should be renamed to a .save extension
(indicated by a '\fB*\fP' prefix in the pacman database).  The \fB--nosave\fP
will turn off all file backups.
.TP
.B "\-r, \-\-root <path>"
Specify alternative installation root (default is "/"). This
should \fInot\fP be used as a way to install software into
e.g. /usr/local instead of /usr. Instead this should be used
if you want to install a package on a temporary mounted partition,
which is "owned" by another system. By using this option you not only
specify where the software should be installed, but you also
specify which package database to use.
