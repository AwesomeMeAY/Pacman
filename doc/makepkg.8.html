makepkg - package build utility
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>makepkg</B>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>makepkg</B> will build packages for you.  All it needs is
a build-capable linux platform, wget, and some build scripts.  The advantage
to a script-based build is that you only really do the work once.  Once you
have the build script for a package, you just need to run makepkg and it
will do the rest: download source files, check dependencies, 
configure the buildtime settings, build the package, install the package
into a temporary root, make customizations, generate meta-info, and package
the whole thing up for <B>pacman</B> to use.
<P>
<B>makeworld</B> can be used to rebuild an entire package group, or the
entire build tree.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUILD PROCESS (or How To Build Your Own Packages)</H2>

Start in an isolated directory (ie, it's not used for anything other
than building this package).  The build script should be called PKGBUILD
and it should bear resemblance to the example below.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> If you have a local copy of the Arch Build System (ABS) tree
on your computer, you can copy the PKGBUILD.proto file to your new package
build directory and edit it from there.  To acquire/sync the ABS tree, use
the <B>abs</B> script included with pacman/makepkg.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DT></DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PKGBUILD Example:</H2>

<DD>
<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
pkgname=modutils
pkgver=2.4.13
pkgrel=1
pkgdesc=&quot;Utilities for inserting and removing modules from the linux kernel&quot;
backup=(etc/modules.conf)
depends=('glibc&gt;=2.2.5' 'bash' 'zlib')
source=(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.server.com/$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.server.com/$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz</A> modules.conf)

build() {
  cd $startdir/src/$pkgname-$pkgver
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make || return 1
  make prefix=$startdir/pkg/usr install
  # copy our custom modules.conf into the package root
  mkdir -p $startdir/pkg/etc
  cp ../modules.conf $startdir/pkg/etc
}
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
As you can see, the setup is fairly simple.  The first three lines define
the package name and version info.  They also define the final package name
which will be of the form <I>$pkgname-$pkgver-$pkgrel.pkg.tar.gz</I>.  The fourth
line provides a brief description of the package.  These four lines should
be present in every PKGBUILD script.
<P>
The line with <I>backup=</I> specifies files that should be treated specially
when removing or upgrading packages.  See <B>HANDLING CONFIG FILES</B> in
the <I>pacman</I> manpage for more information on this.
<P>
The sixth line lists the dependencies for this package.  In order to build/run
the package, all dependencies must be satisifed first.  makepkg will check this
before attempting to build the package.
<P>
Once your PKGBUILD is created, you can run <I>makepkg</I> from the build directory.
makepkg will then check dependencies and look for the source files required to
build.  If some are missing it will attempt to download them, provided there is
a fully-qualified URL in the <I>source</I> array.
<P>
The sources are then extracted into a directory called ./src and
the <I>build</I> function is called.  This is where all package configuration,
building, and installing should be done.  Any customization will likely take
place here.
<P>
After a package is built, the <I>build</I> function must install the package
files into a special package root, which can be referenced by <B>$startdir/pkg</B>
in the <I>build</I> function.  The typical way to do this is one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

make DESTDIR=$startdir/pkg install

or

make prefix=$startdir/pkg/usr install

</PRE>

</DL>

Notice that the &quot;/usr&quot; portion should be present with &quot;prefix&quot;, but not &quot;DESTDIR&quot;.
<P>
Once the package is successfully installed into the package root, <I>makepkg</I>
will remove some directories (as per Arch Linux package guidelines; if you use
this elsewhere, feel free to change it) like /usr/doc and /usr/info.  It will
then strip debugging info from libraries and binaries and generate a meta-info
file.  Finally, it will compress everything into a .pkg.tar.gz file and leave it
in the directory you ran <B>makepkg</B> from.
<P>
At this point you should have a package file in the current directory, named
something like name-version-release.pkg.tar.gz.  Done!
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Install/Upgrade/Remove Scripting</H2>

Pacman has the ability to store and execute a package-specific script when it
installs, removes, or upgrades a package.  This allows a package to &quot;configure
itself&quot; after installation and do the opposite right before it is removed.
<P>
The exact time the script is run varies with each operation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>post_install</B>

<DD>
script is run right after files are installed.
<P>
<DT><B>post_upgrade</B>

<DD>
script is run after all files have been upgraded.
<P>
<DT><B>pre_remove</B>

<DD>
script is run right before files are removed.
<P>

To use this feature, just create a file (eg, pkgname.install) and put it in
the same directory as the PKGBUILD script.  Then use the <I>install</I> directive:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
install=pkgname.install
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The install script does not need to be specified in the <I>source</I> array.
<P>
<DT><DT></DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Install scripts must follow this format:</H2>

<DD>
<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# arg 1:  the new package version
post_install() {
  #
  #  do post-install stuff here
  #
  /bin/true
}

# arg 1:  the new package version
# arg 2:  the old package version
post_upgrade() {
  #
  #  do post-upgrade stuff here
  #
  /bin/true
}

# arg 1:  the old package version
pre_remove() {
  #
  #  do pre-remove stuff here
  #
  /bin/true
}

op=$1
shift

$op $*
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
This template is also available in your ABS tree (/usr/abs/install.proto).

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PKGBUILD Directives</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>pkgname</B>

<DD>
The name of the package.  This has be a unix-friendly name as it will be
used in the package filename.
<P>
<DT><B>pkgver</B>

<DD>
This is the version of the software as released from the author (eg, 2.7.1).
<P>
<DT><B>pkgrel</B>

<DD>
This is the release number specific to Arch Linux packages.
<P>
<DT><B>pkgdesc</B>

<DD>
This should be a brief description of the package and its functionality.
<P>
<DT><B>backup</B>

<DD>
A space-delimited array of filenames (without a preceding slash). The
<I>backup</I> line will be propagated to the package meta-info file for
pacman.  This will designate all files listed there to be backed up if this
package is ever removed from a system.  See <B>HANDLING CONFIG FILES</B> in
the <I>pacman</I> manpage for more information.
<P>
<DT><B>install</B>

<DD>
Specified a special install script that is to be included in the package.
This file should reside in the same directory as the PKGBUILD, and will be
copied into the package by makepkg.  It does not need to be included in the
<I>source</I> array.  (eg, install=modutils.install)
<P>
<DT><B>depends</B>

<DD>
An array of packages that this package depends on to build and run.  Packages
in this list should be surrounded with single quotes and contain at least the
package name.  They can also include a version requirement of the form
<B>name&lt;&gt;version</B>, where &lt;&gt; is one of these three comparisons: <B>&gt;=</B>
(greater than equal to), <B>&lt;=</B> (less than or equal to), or <B>=</B> (equal to).
See the PKGBUILD example above for an example of the <I>depends</I> directive.
<P>
<DT><B>conflicts</B>

<DD>
An array of packages that will conflict with this package (ie, they cannot both
be installed at the same time).  This directive follows the same format as
<I>depends</I> except you cannot specify versions here, only package names.
<P>
<DT><B>source</B>

<DD>
The <I>source</I> line is an array of source files required to build the
package.  Source files must reside in the same directory as the PKGBUILD
file, unless they have a fully-qualified URL.  Then if the source file
does not already exist in /var/cache/pacman/src, the file is downloaded
by wget.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MAKEPKG OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c, --clean</B>

<DD>
Clean up leftover work files/directories after a successful build.
<DT><B>-i, --install</B>

<DD>
Install/Upgrade the package after a successful build.
<DT><B>-s, --syncdeps</B>

<DD>
Install missing dependencies using pacman.  When makepkg finds missing
dependencies, it will run pacman to try and resolve them.  If successful,
pacman will download the missing packages from a package repository and
install them for you.
<DT><B>-b, --builddeps</B>

<DD>
Build missing dependencies from source.  When makepkg finds missing
dependencies, it will look for the dependencies' PKGBUILD files under
$ABSROOT (set in your /etc/makepkg.conf).  If it finds them it will
run another copy of makepkg to build and install the missing dependencies.
The child makepkg calls will be made with the <B>-b</B> and <B>-i</B> options.
<DT><B>-d, --nodeps</B>

<DD>
Do not perform any dependency checks.  This will let you override/ignore any
dependencies required.  There's a good chance this option will break the build
process if all of the dependencies aren't installed.
<DT><B>-f, --force</B>

<DD>
<B>makepkg</B> will not build a package if a <I>pkgname-pkgver-pkgrel.pkg.tar.gz</I>
file already exists in the build directory.  You can override this behaviour with
the <B>--force</B> switch.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

Configuration options are stored in <I>/etc/makepkg.conf</I>.  This file is parsed
as a bash script, so you can export any special compiler flags you wish
to use.  This is helpful for building for different architectures, or with
different optimizations.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> This does not guarantee that all package Makefiles will use
your exported variables.  Some of them are flaky...
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SEE ALSO</H2>

<B>pacman</B> is the package manager that uses packages built by makepkg.
<P>
See the Arch Linux Documentation for package-building guidelines if you wish
to contribute packages to the Arch Linux project.
