               pacman - Package Management Utility

               by Judd Vinet <jvinet@zeroflux.org>

DESCRIPTION:
------------
   pacman is a utility which manages software packages in Linux.  It uses
   simple .tar.gz files as a package format, and maintains a text-based
   package database (more of a hierarchy), just in case some hand tweaking
	 is necessary.

   pacman does not strive to "do everything."  It will add, remove and
   upgrade packages in the system, and it will allow you to query the
   package database for installed packages, files and owners.  It also
	 attempts to handle dependencies automatically and can 

   Although the package manager itself is quite simple, the pacman tarball
   also comes with scripts that help automate building and installing
   packages.  These are used extensively in the Arch Build System (ABS),
   used in Arch Linux <http://www.archlinux.org>.

   As of version 2.0, pacman can also keep your system's packages in
	 sync with a master server.  You can follow CURRENT and STABLE trees,
	 or lock yourself into a specific version.  See the pacman manpage
	 for more info on this (--sync operation).


INSTALL:
--------
$ make install
or
$ make DESTDIR=/your/path/here install

If your man files are located in a directory other than /usr/man, you may
want to edit Makefile and modify the MANDIR line accordingly.

Note:  Since pacman is compiled statically, you will need the static libraries
       for glibc and zlib.


BUGS:
-----
If you find bugs (which is quite likely), please submit them to
<jvinet@zeroflux.org> with specific information, such as your
commandline, the nature of the bug, and even the package database if
it helps.
