               pacman - Package Management Utility

               by Judd Vinet <jvinet@zeroflux.org>

DESCRIPTION:
------------
   pacman is a utility which manages software packages in Linux.  It uses
   simple .tar.gz files as a package format, and maintains a text-based
   package database, just in case some hand tweaking is necessary.

   pacman does not strive to "do everything."  It will add, remove and
   upgrade packages in the system, and it will allow you to query the
   package database for installed packages, files and owners.

   Plans exist for dependency checking and remote file fetching, as well.
   See TODO for more info.


INSTALL:
--------
$ make install
or
$ make DESTDIR=/your/path/here install

If your man files are located in a directory other than /usr/man, you may
want to edit Makefile and modify the MANDIR line accordingly.

Note:  Since pacman is compiled statically, you will need the static libraries
       for glibc and zlib.


BUGS:
-----
If you find bugs (which is quite likely at version 1.0), please submit
them to <jvinet@zeroflux.org> with specific information, such as your
commandline, the nature of the bug, and even the package database, if
it helps.
