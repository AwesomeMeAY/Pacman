VERSION         DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7.6         - added --print-uris option
              - fixed an http download bug (bug #667)
              - fixed a segfault related to replaces/conflicts handling
2.7.5         - "replaces" packages were ignoring IgnorePkg in pacman.conf
              - fixed another bug in conflict handling
              - found an out-dated reference to /usr/abs, fixed
              - added a --recursive option for package removal, which removes
                all deps of a target that aren't required by other packages
2.7.4         - fixed a bug in conflict handling, where installing a
                conflicting package would fail even if the new package
                "provided" it
              - if pacman sees a newer version of itself during an upgrade,
                it will ask to install itself first, then be re-run to upgrade
                the other packages.
              - You can now use the --info option with --sync to display an
                uninstalled package's dependency info.

              - Modified pacman's behaviour wrt provides -- it now allows
                multiple packages to be installed, even if they provide the
                same thing (they were treated as conflicts before)
2.6           - Added group handling, so one can run 'pacman -S kde' and

                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
