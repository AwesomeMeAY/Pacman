                - FTPAGENT setting in makepkg.conf
                - Added --cleancache option to makepkg
2.3.1         - Fixed the progress bar overflow
              - Pacman does not ask "Are you sure" when you use --downloadonly
              - Switched up a couple makepkg options to be more consistent
                with pacman's options
              - If you ^C out of a file download, the package will now be
                removed from the cache directory
2.3           - The beginnings of source-side dependency resolution, makepkg
                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
                -S; or B) find missing deps in the /usr/abs tree and
                build/install them.

              - Changed db_find_conflicts() to ignore directories
