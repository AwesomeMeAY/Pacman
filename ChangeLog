------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.1         - Added retries to the downloader to get around some
                transient network errors.  (this will likely be an option
                in pacman.conf for later versions)
2.5           - Added an URL tag to package info
              - Sped up package load times by about 500% by introducing
                a .FILELIST into the package
              - Renamed the install scriptlet from ._install to .INSTALL
              - Added patch from Aurlien Foret:

                - the REQUIREDBY field is now updated when a package is

                removed from the cache directory
2.3           - The beginnings of source-side dependency resolution, makepkg
                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
                -S; or B) find missing deps in the /usr/abs tree and
                build/install them.
